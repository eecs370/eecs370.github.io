The good news is that C syntax is almost identical to that of
C++. However, there are many things you're used to that aren't available in
C:

<ul>
<li>classes and all their associated tricks: templates, inheritance, etc.
<li><code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>
<li>the stream operators <code>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</code>
<li>the <code>// </code> comment character
<li>the bool keyword
<li>all those weird casting operators (dynamic_cast, static_cast)
<li>the standard libraries you're used to (e.g. iostream)
<li>lots of other stuff
</ul>

We'll cover some of the basics here. The end of this document has
a couple of recommended books where you can go for further information
(including classic book on C written by Kernighan and Ritchie and
referred to here as K&R). The man pages are also a great source of information.

<h2>Comments</h2>
The only valid way to specify a comment in C is like so:

<pre>

/* this is a comment */

/* This is a multiline
   comment */

</pre>

You <em>cannot</em> nest comments. 

<pre>
 /* This is  /*nested */ comment. And is illegal. */
</pre>




<h2>I/O</h2>
C doesn't have stream operators. Instead you'll want to use the
functions provided in the stdio library.  In particular: printf,
fprintf, fgets, fputs.

<h3>Output: printf, fprintf, fputs</h3>

The most common output function in C is printf() which prints characters to the screen (or wherever standard out is directed to go). Here's a quick hello world program that illustrates its use:
<pre>
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 int main() {
   printf("Hello World");
 }
</pre>

printf() has a variable number of arguments, the first of which is a format
string.  The format string can contain both ordinary characters (what
you want to appear on the screen like 'Hello World' above) and
conversion character sequences.  You can think of conversion characters as
placeholders for a specific type formatted in a particular way.  Conversion character sequences begin with %
and end with a conversion character.  An example will perhaps make this
clearer.  Here we're printing out the integers from 0 to 9.

<pre>

 int i;
 for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
   printf("the variable 'i' is: %d", i);
 }

</pre>

The conversion sequence is %d, which you can think of as a placeholder
for an integer.  Since this is the first conversion character sequence, the
value of the first argument after the format string--in this case the value of 'i'-- will be placed in the held spot.  Conversion characters can specify type, precision, and
all sorts of other formatting information. See K&R or the man pages
for all the gory details, but here are essential ones cribbed from K&R:

<pre>
   sequence    type   : produces

   %d or %i  - int    : signed decimal notation
   %s        - char * : prints characters until the null character is reached
   %x        - int    : hexidecimal notation
   %p        - void * : prints as a pointer 
</pre>

<p>
printf() always prints to standard out.  If you want to print to another
place, such as standard error, use fprintf() which takes as its first
argument the stream you're printing on:

<pre>
  fprintf(stderr, "Fatal Error #2212. We're hosed");
  /* or with values */
  fprintf(stderr, "Fatal Error in foo(): value of bar is %p\n", bar);
</pre>

Note that we're calling standard in, out, and error slightly different
names than we do in C++:

<pre>
   C++   C

   cin   stdin
  cout   stdout
  cerr   stderr
</pre>



Finally, fputs() will also allow us to write to a stream.
<pre>
  int fputs(const char *str, FILE *stream);
</pre>
fputs() takes a null-terminated string 'str' and writes it to 'stream'.  It
omits the null character when it does this.  It returns a non-negative
integer if okay and EOF on error.

An example:
<pre>
  if ( (fputs("Hello world", stdout)) == EOF) {
    fprint(stderr, "Whoops, something went wrong");
 }
</pre>

fputs() functions similarly to printf() when it writes to stdout, but
it doesn't do any conversion which probably means it's quite a bit faster.


<h3>Input</h3>
Input is a bit trickier.  For reading an entire line you'll probably
want to use fgets().  Here's the prototype:

<pre>
  char *fgets(char *buffer, int size, FILE *stream);
</pre>

fgets() reads up to size-1 characters from stream and stores them in
buffer.  fgets() stores the null character ('\0') after the last
character read into the buffer and returns 'buffer' if everything
works fine, or NULL on error or end of file. Here's an example:

<pre>
  char *cptr;
  char buffer[256];
  
  printf("Enter some stuff:\n");
  cptr = fgets(buffer, 256, stdin);
  if(cptr != NULL) {
    printf("You typed : %s\n", cptr);
  } 

</pre>


Here's a more complicated example.  Readline() uses fgets() to read up
to MAX_LINE - 1 characters into the buffer 'in'.  It strips preceding
whitespace and returns a pointer to the first non-whitespace character.  

<pre>
 char *Readline(char *in) {
   char *cptr;
 
   if (cptr = fgets(in, MAX_LINE, stdin)) {
     /* kill preceding whitespace but leave \n 
        so we're guaranteed to have something*/
     while(*cptr == ' ' || *cptr == '\t') {
       cptr++;
     }
     return cptr;    
    } else {
     return 0;
   }
 }

</pre>



<h2>Memory Allocation</h2>
There are no memory management operators such as <code>new</code> and
<code>delete</code> in C.  All memory allocation is done with the
function malloc().  Here's its prototype:  
<pre>
  void * malloc(int nbytes)
</pre>
malloc() takes an int indicating the number of bytes you want
allocated and it returns a void pointer to the start of the allocated
memory.  

<pre>
  /* We're going to allocate enough space for an integer 
     and assign 5 to that memory location */
  int *foo;
  /* malloc call: note the cast of the return value
     from a void * to the appropriate pointer type */
  foo = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));  
  *foo = 5;

</pre>

Even more complicated structures like arrays are allocated through
malloc():

<pre>
  /* Here we're allocating space for 5 integers */
  int *foo;
  foo = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);
  foo[0] = 17;
  foo[4] = 22;
</pre>

Freeing memory is done with the function free().  The prototype: 

<pre>
  void free(void *);
</pre>
Here's an example of it being used:
<pre>
  free(foo);
</pre>

Pretty simple.  However, note that it's disastrous to free a piece of
memory that's already been freed.
<p>
More information is available in the man pages. 


<h2>Variable Declaration</h2>

In C++ you can declare variables pretty much anywhere in your
program.  This is not the case with C.  Variables must be declared at
the beginning of a function and must be declared before any other
code.  This <em>includes</em> loop counter variables, which means you
can't do this:
<pre>
  for(int i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
</pre>
Forgetting that you can't declare variables just anywhere is one of the most frequent causes of  'it won't compile' problems for programmers moving from C++ to C.

<h2>Constants</h2>
The standard way to declare a constant in C is to use #define. 

<pre>
  #define MAX_LEN 1024
  #define NUM_CALLS 20
</pre>

This is also valid C++ code, though the use of #define is usually
discouraged in C++.  Like all preprocessor directives, #defines
usually appear at the top of the source file.


<h2>Types</h2>

<h3>structs</h3>
C has no classes, but you can create composite types with <code>struct</code>: 

<pre>

  struct point {
    int x;
    int y;
  };

</pre>
You would then use it like so:

<pre>

  struct point p;
  p.x = 0;
  p.y = 0;

</pre>

While this is acceptable, the preferred approach is to use
pointers when using structures:

<pre>

  struct point *p;
  p = (struct point *) malloc(sizeof(struct point));
  p->x = 0;
  p->y = 0;

</pre>

The struct qualifier is <em>required</em> any time you're referring to a
struct.  You can see this above in the cast of the return value from
malloc() and in the sizeof expression.  In other words, having declared
the struct point, we can't simply write:

<pre>
 /* this code won't work */
 point p;
 p.x = 0;

</pre>

as we would with a C++ class.  We can get rid of this repetition of
the struct qualifier by using typedefs.  The <code>typedef </code>
keyword essentially creates an alias.  Thus we can typedef struct
point to Point (or to lowercase 'point', but we're using uppercase to
remind ourselves it's a struct).

<pre>
  typdef struct point Point;
  Point *p;
  p = (Point *) malloc(sizeof(Point);
  p->x = 0;
</pre>


<h3>booleans</h3>

There is no <code>bool</code> keyword in C.  Instead booleans in C are
the same as integers with a value of 0 for false or 1 for true.  Thus
the following is an infinite loop:

<pre>
  while(1) {
    ; /* do nothing */
  }
</pre>



<h2>Libraries</h2>

Libraries functions are included by specying the name of the
appropriate header file in an include statement:

<pre>
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #include &lt;string.h&gt;
</pre>

This is similar to C++ but the .h is required.  
<P> 
Here are some of the most useful C libraries:
<ul>
<li>stdio : printf, fprintf, sprintf, fgets, fputs
<li>string : strcpy, strcmp, strncmp, strtok, strlen
<li>stdlib : utility functions: atoi, atol, 
<li>assert : useful in debugging: assert
</ul>

You should know what most of these functions do, especially strtok()
which you'll be using at a crucial point in the Yash shell.

<h2>Other References</h2>
More information is available in the man pages and also in the best
book on C: <i>The C++ Programming Language</i> by Kernighan and
Ritchie (referred to as K&R by nearly everyone).  <i>Expert
C Programming</i> by Peter Van Der Linden is also an excellent book on all
kinds of advanced C topics such as linking, the differences between pointers
and arrays, and how to make sense of stuff like this:

<pre>

 int *(*foo[20]) (char *c);

</pre>

It also has a pretty good description of program memory.
